== `go mod` not well supported in CI

Ideally, as described in https://medium.com/rungo/anatomy-of-modules-in-go-c8274d215c16[https://medium.com/rungo/anatomy-of-modules-in-go-c8274d215c16],
`go mod` is the best way to build and packaging.

However, within You company, there is not way to open access to all external repos, so `go mod download` will not work.

The workaround is using vendor mechanism, i.e., put the dependency packages to `vendor` folder. sigh!

So in local, you can use `go mod`, but just make sure you copy all dependencis to `vendor` before you check in to git.

== Put project under `~/go/src` ($GOPATH)

This is for locating the package. If your package is `httpgo`, and your project folder `httpgo`, then if your project
path is `$GOPATH/httpgo`, then to refer to the package, you need `httpgo/httpgo`.
